## About

The client, Gary, wants a mobile application to be installed by students in a specific classroom. Students and instructors will be able to sign up. They'll be able to give their demographic information. Their movements will be tracked inside a pre-configured classroom. At the end of the class, they will be presented with a survey about their specific movements. 

The Admin Webpage should allow admin to access this data and will allow admin to add users to the database.
